Backbone Tunes: A backbone.js demo
==================================

- Displays a list of available albums and their tracks
- Allows queueing albums for playback
- Plays the queue, one track at a time

USAGE
=====

This version of the application runs as a static site and
does not require any Ruby web server.

To use, drag "public/index.html" to your browser.

(The preferred way is to run a dynamic webserver. See 9-final for
details).

CHANGES
=======

To work as a static site, the following changes were made:

* public/index.html: Call window.library.reset() with JSON data.
* public/js/Tunes.js: Explicitly call App.home() to load the router.
* CSS: Use relative paths for images.
